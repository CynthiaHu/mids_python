This shouldn't really apply to the work that you are doing now but should provide some food for thought at the very least. Think about his perspective and why he seems to have come to it. Please don't worry about knowing all the terminology or programs/systems that he refers to. I want you to extract what he's trying to say about writing code not the intricacies of the low level systems that is referring to.\n"

    "    - By default stores a full deck of 52 playing cards (with proper numbers and suits) in the \"cards\" list. <br>\n",
    "    - Allows the user to specify a specific suit.  In this case, the program should only populate the deck with the 13 cards of that suit.\n",
    "    - After the cards object is initialized, call the \"shuffle_deck()\" function (below).<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A \"shuffle_deck()\" function that randomly changes the order of cards in the deck.<br>\n",
    "- A \"deal_card(card_count)\" function that removes the first X cards from the deck and returns them as a list.<br>\n",

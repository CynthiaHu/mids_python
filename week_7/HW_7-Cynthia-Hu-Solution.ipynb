This shouldn't really apply to the work that you are doing now but should provide some food for thought at the very least. Think about his perspective and why he seems to have come to it. Please don't worry about knowing all the terminology or programs/systems that he refers to. I want you to extract what he's trying to say about writing code not the intricacies of the low level systems that is referring to.\n"

I agree with the author that we need to have fewer dependencies in our code and have modules so that it's easy for change the codes. That reminds that in my solution to scrabble problem, I only create one function as requested but use normal codes for all other functionalities. Instead, I could improve my codes by create a few more functions and call them in my main script.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I don't understand why we care about the number of lines of codes so much. It should be ok if the codes are efficient and effective. Another concern is that it's great to separate my codes as the scrabble example. But if I don't need to reuse the parts, shall I still need to create functions for various parts. I haven't found clear guidance in the article yet.\n",

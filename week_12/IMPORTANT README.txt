Note:
This assignment requires that you download a large data file from the internet.

Do NOT try to "commit" this data file to your repository.  Github will give you an error that the file is too large, and it can be complicated to roll back the commit in your local repository to get back in sync.  Be sure to only "git add" the files you want to commit (your solution notebook)!

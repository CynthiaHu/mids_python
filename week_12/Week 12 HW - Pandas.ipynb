    "In this assignment you will apply what you are learning to answer questions about campaign contributions in the Democratic presidential primary race. We will use the csv file located inside the dataset \"CA.zip\", available online at the fec.gov website, here: http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do. You will need to download then \"unzip\" the file and save the csv in the same folder as this notebook.\n",

    "Note - While we've left one code/markdown cell for you after each question as a placeholder, some of your answers will require multiple cells to fully respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load in the data. Note we define a custom date parser to speed up import (we could have Python guess the date format, but this can make the load a lot slower).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also subset the data to look at the primary period.  Otherwise, we would see general election donations which would make it harder to draw conclusions about the primaries.  We will analyze through May 2016."

    For ages you had lived in the cave, and for all that time it had always been bone dry.
Then the rain fell, and your whole world changed forever. Your adventure begins here, nowhere.
While on your journey, you will venture through nowhere, until ultimately ending up nowhere.
And having come from nowhere, traveling within nowhere, and finally reaching nowhere, you
may at last find out what it all meant. If there is any moral to the story, you will find
it at the end. Can you make it there?

You know there must be something to this, but
you decide to wait until you are absolutely sure.

You insert the green crystal into the machine. The sky suddenly turns a bright white,
and the cube begins to glow yellow. You can feel that the crystal is totally secure,
but something is keeping you from removing it now that it is in.

You insert the red crystal into the machine. The sky suddenly turns a dark red,
and the cube begins to glow yellow. You can feel that the crystal is totally secure,
but something is keeping you from removing it now that it is in.

Devastation. The machine does not create chaos, panic, or fear. The machine
creates only burning. Nowhere in nowhere is protected from the machine's incredible power.
Nowhere is no more. Such a devastating event, its really a shame no one was around to witness it.


<>

Revival. Out of the meaningless reality of nowhere, the machine creates reason. Understanding and
wisdom falls upon the ears of those living in nowhere. To some of them, they are just words like
any other. To most, they are nice words that make them feel safe and smile when no one else is around
like goddamn psychopaths. The land of nowhere was made a better place.

    And thus, the awesome power of the machine marked a new era in history, for better or for worse.
Naturally, neither your actions or the machine itself really changed anything at all. Such is the way
things ought to unfold in a place like this. You came from nowhere, traveled through nowhere, ended
up nowhere, and absolutely non of it mattered in the slightest. You really must take pride in such a
great accomplishment. After all, if you don't remember this adventure, who will?

The End

        The next thing you know, you are in a white padded cell. In the cell with you is a locked
    safe and a hand-held mirror. On the wall is a computer terminal, and the interface seems
    to indicate that an artificial intelligence is installed. You don't know why, but you
    immediately pick up the mirror upon recognition.

        As you sink, you briefly wonder where it is you might be going to this time around.
    After the moment passes, you remember what journey it is that you are on.

Autobiography
by Samuel P.

    '...the FIRST time I encountered the green crystal was in my youth.
    Never had I ever imagined that such a power could exist in a world
    like this. Our world of nothing given meaning and reason for the first
    time...'

Why The Power Crystals were a Mistake
by R.J Mann

    '...one should not be fooled by the overdramatic anecdotes provided
    by Samuel Paul. I'm afraid that there just isn't a middle ground here.
    It wasn't long ago that the same rhetoric was used in favor of the
    red crystal...'

Red Without Mercy

        As you pass through the portal again, you start having visions. It is difficult
    for you to make any sense of them. One minute you are witnessing the
    coming of perfect utopia, the next you are watching the world in flames.
    Non of it makes sense, and it is over before you know it.

        You find yourself in a dark void.  You are able to see your immediate surroundings,
    but beyond that is pure darkness. Its as if you are being illuminated by a spotlight, but
    no light source can be seen.

        The power of the crystal causes you to faint. While you are unconscious, you experience the events
    that unfolded over and over in the form of dreams. You remain lucid during the entire experience, but
    you are somehow incapable of causing the events in each dream to unfold in any other way.

COMMANDS

    'look' -- Use this command to get information about your environment.

    'use' -- When you input this command, the game will ask you to specify an item in
             your inventory to use, and then asks you to specify an object in the game 
             to interact with. You can also input 'direct' instead of an item and the game
             will allow you to interact directly via a body part.

    'inventory' -- This command will show you what is in your inventory.

    'inspect' -- When you input this command, the game will ask you to specify an object
                 in the game and then give you information about that object.

    'quit' -- This quits the game

    'talk' -- When you input this command, the game will ask you to specify an object
              in the game. If that object is a character in the game, you will engage
              in a conversation with that character.

    'take'/'drop' -- the 'take' command will allow you to pick up objects in the world,
                     the 'drop' command will allow you to remove an object from your
                     inventory.

PASSWORDS

    When you quit the game, you will be given a password to the chapter that you are currently on.
    By selecting 'enter password' from the menu, you can use the password you were give to return to
    the spot you left off.

TIPS

    1) Inspect everything.
    2) Interacting directly with things works exactly how it sounds, you just
       have to specify the part of the body you use.
    3) Type the names of objects exactly as they are printed. When in doubt,
       lower case!
    4) Not all of the puzzles are meant to be intuitive, so don't expect them
       to be.  However, patterns will emerge if you are paying attention.
       If you get stuck, try to remember what you did last time you were
       in a similar situation.
